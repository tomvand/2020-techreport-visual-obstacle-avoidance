In October 2018 I went through the go/no-go evaluation for my PhD studies.
For this evaluation I wrote an extensive report on the results of my first year. 
Since I spent most of that year reviewing literature, the majority of that report consisted of a literature survey on visual obstacle avoidance, primarily focused on the practical implementation on small drones.
While the report was only intended for my evaluation, I have started getting requests from MSc students to view my literature survey and it has recently had its first citation in an MSc thesis.
Since this survey might also be of help to other people in the field of visual obstacle avoidance, I have decided to make this literature review public.

This technical report is an extract from my original go/no-go report, from which my personal information has been removed.
The rest of the document remains unchanged, except for the removal of copyrighted images and the fixing of occasional typos.
While I hope that all information in this document is correct, please note that it has not been peer-reviewed.
Nevertheless, I hope that reading this report will be as useful to you as the writing of it was to me.
